# GloVe

GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.

There are kinds of the file we can deal with, we'll select one of them and download it.

We're going to choose this file set (6B tokens, 400K vocab, uncased, 50d, 100d, 200d, & 300d vectors, 822 MB)

You can download this kind of GloVe files from [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip)
